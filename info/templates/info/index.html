                    <p style = "font-size:15px">Coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery diesease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease. The disease develops as a result of atherosclerosis, the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on your artery walls (plaque), which can restrict blood flow. The plaque can burst, triggering a blood clot. It is when atherosclerosis occurs in the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that transport oxygen and blood to the heart, that CHD occurs.In some cases, this can lead to cases of heart attack. The disease's symptoms develop gradually, making it more common among the elderly.
